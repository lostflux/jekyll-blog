# Getting Started with Jekyll

[Jekyll][jekyll]
is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub Pages
and works well with various other hosting suites.
It allows you to, among other things, write clean content
in Markdown... and save yourself the trouble of writing hundreds
of `html` files by hand if you want to make a blog.
It is of course usable for other things, blogs just happen to
be an easy example.

It's how we get from nothing to a fancy blog in 5 minutes.

> Okay, maybe not 5 minutes, but it's pretty quick.

It's this easy :point_down:



## Steps to Starting out a Blog with Jekyll

### 1. Grab a template?

Jekyll has a surprisingly substantial community of developers
and designers who have created templates for themselves and
are willing to let you use. For free. Or for _somewhat_ small fee.

Save yourself the trouble of starting afresh and
[browse some themes][themes].
Once you've found your favorite, clone the starter repo
from GitHub and check it out in your code editor.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Dependencies, dependencies, dependencies... You know the story.

#### :point_right: Framework Dependencies

<!-- ##### Ruby -->

Jekyll is a [Ruby gem][ruby-gem] so you'll need to have Ruby installed
if you don't already have it.

```bash
  ruby -v
  # if this prints something greater than 2.0.0
  # then you're good.
  
  # if not...
  brew install ruby       # mac
  sudo apt install ruby   # linux
```

While at it, also install the Ruby package manager, `bundler`.

```bash
  gem install bundler
```

#### :point_right: Site Dependencies

Now install the dependencies for the Jekyll theme you chose.

```bash
  cd "<path to your local clone>"
  bundle install
```



#### :point_right: Launch the Dev Server

```bash
  bundle exec jekyll s
```

> If you prefer to start from scratch;
> ```bash
>   # create a new Jekyll site
>   jekyll new site-name
>   cd site-name
>
>   # start the server
>   bundle exec jekyll s
> ```
>

### 3. Write some content

Head into the `_posts` directory and create a new **Markdown** file
named `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` and drop in some content.

#### :point_right: Front Matter

The first thing you'll notice is that the file starts with a
**front matter** section. This is a YAML section that tells Jekyll
important context about the file and what it needs to do with it,
such as:
- The title of the post/page.
- Which layout needs to be applied.
- The date of the post. 
- Post metadata, such as categories and tags.

```yaml

tags: [jekyll, static-site-generators, blog]
---
```

#### :point_right: Content

The rest of the file is just regular Markdown.
Try to keep it sane &mdash; you know, spaces around
your headings and other Markdown whatnots.
You can also add extensions, such as [jemoji][jemoji],
which adds GitHub-flavored emoji support to your Markdown
(example, `:point_right:` = :point_right:).

Refresh your browser and you should see your new post.

### 4. Customize :grey_question:

Most themes are extensible and customizable.
But...

- It's up to you to figure out how each theme dev designed their theme.
- You don't have access to the source code of the theme.
- Figuring out how to customize some existing components
  (that you've not written yourself) will take some work.
  Customizing/generating content is easy. Customizing some aspects of the theme is hard. If you're a control freak, you may want to start from scratch. 

For the much that you can do, though,

- `_config.yml` is the main Jekyll configuration file for your site.
- `Gemfile` tracks all your dependencies and their versions.
  (Think `package.json` for Ruby).
- Support for `SASS` and `SCSS` is built-in (nice!).

Lots of toggles! With controlled effects.

#### Writing Your Own `HTML` Components

You know it. Eventually you'll want to. Here's how to:

- All `HTML` components go in the `_includes` directory.
- `CSS` / `SCSS` goes in the `assets/css` directory.
- "link" your `CSS` file in your `HTML` template.

> See example in `about` tab.

### 5. Data APIs? :thinking:

- Put data in a `filename.yaml` file in the `_data` directory,
  and it will be accessible through `site.data.filename` variable.
- Nice composability!

> See example in `about` tab.

### 6. Deploy :boom:

`bundle exec jekyll build` will build your site into the `_site` directory.
What you do with that information is entirely up to you &mdash;
but you may want to let your hosting provider know
so they can react accordingly when they see a new commit.

```bash
  # install deps and build!
  bundle &&  bundle exec jekyll build
```

### 7. Resources :books:

- More on static vs. dynamic sites :point_right: [video][static-vs-dynamic].
- More on static site generators :point_right: [video][static-site-gen].
- Tutorial on Jekyll :point_right: [video][tutorial-video].

TL;DR: Lots of resources on the internet. You'll be fine.
